## Front End Dog Spa
### Practicing Javascript
This is practice convering the dog spa python benchmark into a front end app for Base Camp Coding Academy students.
### The Assignment
Use the template to build out the application, and it is a single page using `index.html`.\
All the options should have buttons to explain the services provided at the dog spa, and the user should be able to click the options they desire.\ There should be a "check-out" button added, and it should calculate the user's total purchase and provide a summary of the purchase (a list of the services bought).\
Users have to select at least one service in order to check-out, and the application should be designed to only allow a single purchase of an item (i.e. users are unable to buy more than one bath).\
Limited styling can be added in the `style.css` file, but the majority of the styling should be done using Bootstrap (included in template).\
Do not change the data structure in `data.js`, this assignment is inteded to be manipulating an array of objects. If desired, an option image url can be added for each of the objects in the `SERVICES` array.\
All DOM manipulation is to be done in the `script.js` file.
